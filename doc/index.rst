Welcome to instagraal's documentation!
======================================

InstaGRAAL is a Hi-C based scaffolder written with large genome assemblies in mind. 
As such, it also provides a comprehensive framework for generating,
storing and analyzing Hi-C data, as well as a number of polishing libraries for
post-scaffolding use. The present documentation is dedicated to exposing the various APIs
to users who wish to delve deeper into the internal implementation of the scaffolder in order
to better understand how it works and possibly extend its functionalities. The software is
under continuous development with various incoming overhauls, and the documentation
will improve accordingly.
